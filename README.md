# ex3
*this project is used for an implementation of a directed (positive) Weighted Graph in python language.
in addition we compared the run-time complexity of this project, with a similar project written in Java (ex2) and with networkX library. you can see more about that in our wiki.

**some info:**
*there are 3 classes inside `src directory`-> `NodeData` ,`DiGraph`, `GraphAlgo`.

**NodeData**

*this class represents a single vertex of the graph. Each node has 3  instance variables: `key`-a unique  id for this node. `pos`- the position, `tag`- usually used for the algorithm class;

*In this class there are getters and setters(there is no setter for key) and there is `toString()` method;
